## Welcome to "Hello World" with GitHub Actions

This course will walk you through writing your first action and using it with a workflow file. 

**Ready to get started? Navigate to the first issue.**

We start by creating the docker file and adding it to a newly made repository 

Next you will need to make an entrypoint script and add it to the repo 
You can then choose how you want your work to run in the script 

Then we move on to the workflow file and runnig an action from the file aswell as commiting
it to the repo
